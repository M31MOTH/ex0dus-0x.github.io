I mean, you might understand what pointers are, but you don’t really <em>understand</em> them.</p><p>Here’s a nice rundown of how a pointer works, on a “high” level:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void){
  int a = 100, *ptr;
  *ptr = a;
  printf("Memory location of *ptr: %x;\n", *ptr); 
  printf("Memory location of a: %x;",  a);

  printf("The value of (*ptr)++ is: %d", (*ptr)++ )

  /* Of course, you might be tempted to do this:
  int b, *ptr2;
  int *ptr2 = 100;
  int *ptr2 = b;

 RED FLAG! A pointer is a representation of memory, and in no way is it    
 an integer. */
 
}
</code></pre></div><p>and a representation of a lower level:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&amp;a = 0x123              &amp;ptr = 0x456    
-----------             ---------------
| a = 100 | &lt;---------- |*ptr = 0x123 |
-----------             ---------------
    a++     &lt;----------     (*ptr)++
</code></pre></div><p>Now that’s nice and fun, but what is the purpose of utilizing pointers? C, unlike your Python and Javascript, utilizes pointers to modify data more efficiently especially since there is no built-in strings syntax.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>char * name[100] = "Alan";
</code></pre></div><p>Languages such as Python aren’t <strong>explicit</strong> as C, where it is not necessary to declare the type and/or cast of a variable. This makes the language much more tolerable for impatient people like me.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>name = "Alan";
name = 1; # of course, with mutability, I can change the type easily.
</code></pre></div><p>Because of this, Python is <em>dynamically</em> typed. We will explore that later.</p><p>With all this talk about pointers, it still seems a little confusing right? Let me show you one pragmatic example of using pointers in C. Let’s say that I have a function, <code class="highlighter-rouge">swap()</code>, and it is in charge of swapping two integer values that is passed, like so: <code class="highlighter-rouge">swap(int a, int b)</code>. Let’s write this in code, and see what we get.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void swap(int val1, int val2); // function prototype 

void swap(int val1, int val2){  
  int temp = val1; // hold value of a in temp variable
  val1 = val2;    // change value of a to b
  val2 = temp;      // change value of b to temp, which holds the value of a.
}

int main(void){
  int a = 1, b = 2;
  printf("Before swap: a = %i; b = %i\n", a, b); 
  swap(a, b); // a represents val1, b represents val2
  printf("After swap: a = %i; b = %i\n", a, b);
}
</code></pre></div><p>The program looks fine, but once compiled:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc swap.c -o swap
$ ./swap
Before swap: a = 1; b = 2
After swap: a = 1; b = 2
</code></pre></div><p>What happened? Because of the <em>stack</em>. When we are allocating memory on the <em>stack</em>, that memory is attached to a thread of execution, and once complete, all memory goes away. For a structure such as a function, that means that the data allocated within it’s scope, will eventually by deallocated. That means once <code class="highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> finishes its thread of execution, the already swapped values passed by the parameters have been deallocated, and the next output will print the same as the first output.</p><p>Of course, let’s reexamine this example with pointers.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void swap(int *val1, int *val2); 

// I won't write any comments here. Try to interpret the code yourself.

void swap(int *val1, int *val2){  
  int temp = *val1; 
  *val1 = *val2;      
  *val2 = temp;      
}

int main(void){
  int a = 1, b = 2;
  printf("Before swap: a = %i; b = %i\n", a, b); 
  swap(&amp;a, &amp;b); 
  printf("After swap: a = %i; b = %i\n", a, b);
}

---

$ gcc swap.c -o swap
$ ./swap
Before swap: a = 1; b = 2
After swap: a = 2; b = 1
</code></pre></div><p>Remember, pointers are not individual data types, but rather a representation of memory with an origination. When we are working with <code class="highlighter-rouge">val1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">val2</code>, we were simply passing the values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> to it, not the actual memory address. However, once we declare <code class="highlighter-rouge">*val1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">*val2</code> as pointers, we can visualize an arrow that links the pointers to the memory locations of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, or as seen in the code, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;b</code>. The rules of the stack and memory management are still enforced, but once the values within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">swap()</code> function falls out of scope, the values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> have already been swapped, through our trusty pointers.</p><hr /><p>With all this talk about memory, I want to introduce one more concept: dynamic memory allocation. While we were writing our code above, we have worked with <em>static</em> types. This means that we explicitly declared each of our types, and when we compile the program, these data values, their types and sizes are recognized during <strong>compile-time</strong>. This enables the compiler to allocate memory safely. Going back to our comparison with C and Python: since we do not explicitly declare the types of variables and other structures in Python, it is a <em>dynamically</em> typed language. Despite that, this does not mean that we cannot dynamically allocate memory in C.</p><p>When we declare an array, we know that it has a fixed size of elements. It’s size, type, etc. are all known to the compiler as well.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>int array[10];
// we use %zu, since sizeof() returns size_t
printf("Size of array[]: %zu", sizeof(array)); // =&gt; 40; 4 bits for each element
</code></pre></div><p>How about doing this dynamically? We use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">malloc()</code> function from <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdlib.h</code></p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
...
int * array = malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); 
// using malloc, we allocate 40 bits, since the sizeof(int) is 4 bits.

if (array == NULL) { 
  // IF however, we are unable to allocate that, the array returns NULL. This is how we would handle this.
  
  fprintf(stderr, "Could not allocate!\n"); // print to STDERR. Errno can work too.
  return(-1);
}
</code></pre></div><p>Neat feature right? This is important, especially when you work with user input. Using dynamic memory can prevent cases of buffer and stack overflows in memory, but it is important to <strong>free</strong> dynamically allocated memory. C, unlike languages like Rust and Java, does NOT have garbage collectors.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>free(array);
</code></pre></div><p>There are of course, other methods of dynamic memory allocations in C. You may have heard of <code class="highlighter-rouge">calloc()</code>, which is similar to ‘malloc()’.</p><hr /><p>So that’s a litle bit of a rundown on pointers, static and dynamic memory, and dynamic memory allocation in C.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><hr class="dotted" /><footer id="footer"><script src="/js/theme.min.js"></script><script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/8192e56a39.js"></script><a href="https://github.com/ex0dus-0x"> <i class="hvr-grow fa fa-github fa-inverse fa-2x"></i> </a> <a href="mailto:ex0dus@codemuch.tech"> <i class="hvr-grow fa fa-envelope fa-inverse fa-2x"></i> </a> <a href="https://keybase.io/ex0dus/key.asc"> <i class="hvr-grow fa fa-key fa-inverse fa-2x"></i> </a> <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw/wGNAsjw0"> <i class="hvr-grow fa fa-comment fa-inverse fa-2x"></i> </a><p> Made with ♥.
