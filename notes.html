              <br />
              i try my best to write as much documentation as possible for the rust programming language.
              this is my cheat sheet that covers a majority of core Rust programming. 
              this markdown document covers many many topics, and it's a great resource for quick refreshing. 
              includes topics in ownership, lifetime and borrowing. source code also available.
              of course, this repo will be updated as i jump more in depth.

              <br />
                this includes all of my assignments that i have completed, as well as outlines 
                that i rely on, and miscellaneous study guides and flash card sets. i don't recommend
                utilizing my homework as your own, because tha is definitely one way to not get a 4 or 5.
