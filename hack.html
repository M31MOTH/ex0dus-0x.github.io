<h2 class="section-heading"> [hack] introductions</h2>

<p><b>[hack]</b> (or bracket-hack-bracket, or hack array) is a collaborative group that I am creating. It is <b>NOT</b> a hacker group, but just a group for
like-minded hacktivists who wish to share their knowledge and improve their skills and competency. </p>

<p><b>[hack]</b> will also be a sort-of class, where people who wish to learn more about security, programming, computer science, and etc can come together and learn
more through community-driven courses and lessons. Assignments are given, but optional to complete. </p>

<p><b> Just like NYC Resistor, and many other makerspaces and hackerspaces, this group fosters creativity. [hack] has been set up as an organization on GitHub,
and I am looking forward to the member's ideas and projects, which I want to push as a repository. </b></p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> [hack] rules and regulations </h2>
<ul>
  <li> 1. Please don't threaten other members, especially if you are uncapable to do anything yourself </li>
  <li> 2. You do not need to have any experience in code or security, but please have basic computer knowledge </li>
  <li> 3. Always help your fellow members. They are just as valued as you </li>
  <li> 4. I encourage passive arguing and debate. I love it when people argue over controversial topics, since its exciting to look at different perspectives </li>
  <li> 5. Don't worry about inactivity. I probably will be inactive sometimes. This group is sort of like membership to a club. You don't necessarily have to be around all the time </li>
  <li> 6. Always have the capacity and competency to learn! </li>
</ul>
