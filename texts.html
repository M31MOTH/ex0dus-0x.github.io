				 <h4><i>Contains both how-to's and nonfictions </i></h4>
				 <hr>
				 <h3><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript </a></h3>
				 <p> One of the best, modern books on learning JavaScript </p>
				 <h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319">
				 Code: The Hidden Language of Computers</a></h3>
				 <p>Although the book is quite old (2000ish), it is still a classic and describes the mathematical and historical
				 aspects of code, from the beginning of codes to all the way to programming languages in the present.</p>
				 <h3><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a></h3>
				 <p>I remember this was what Offensive Security used as a textbook. This book really teaches you coding in C and assembly, and 
				 but in a "hacker's perspective", with the notion of problem-solving and coming up with innovative ideas, and building exploits and using them,
				 all in an Ubuntu environment. The book is still a classic and is so far one of the best.</p>
				 <h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alan-Turing-Enigma-Inspired-Imitation/dp/069116472X">
				 Alan Turing: The Enigma</a></h3>
				 <p> Read this and did a project for it in middle school. This is probably <b> THE </b> most complete book on <b>EVERYTHING</b>
				 Alan Turing-related.<b> ALL</b> of his work, his <b>ENTIRE </b>life, in and out, in one <b>BIG THICK</b> book. 
				 What more can you ask?</p>
				 <h3><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/automatestuff">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a></h3>
				 <p>As a programmer, after learning a language, I usually ask myself, <i>"ok, what is next? How can I <b>apply</b> what I have learned to create useful
				 programs?"</i>.What I really like about this book is how it is able to introduce to you all of the concepts in the Python
				 programming language, provide exercises for you to do, and then use this knowledge to make <b>USEFUL</b> programs.
				 Most beginner programming books DO NOT do that, and that is what makes this book take the cake. </p>
				 <h3><a href="https://killercup.github.io/trpl-ebook/trpl-2015-05-13-a4.pdf">The Rust Programming Language</a></h3>
				 <p> The all-in-one guide to learning Rust. Rust was a language, in case you haven't really heard of it, that tried to replace C++. The book, created by
				 the Rust Team, isn't meant for beginner programmers, and is mostly Linux/Unix based, but is a great read if you want to casually learn a less-common programming language</p>

                <!--Fiction-->
                <h1 class="section-heading"> Books (Fiction) </h1>
				 <h4><i>Contains biographies, narratives, and fictional works</i></h4>
                 <hr>
				 <h3><a href="http://craphound.com/category/littlebrother/">Little Brother</a></h3>
				 <h5>By: Cory Doctorow </h5>
				 <p> My favorite fictional cyberpunk classics of all time. Doctorow defines the true meaning of hacktivism
				 in his novel, and demonstrates it through the free-willed, determined, and especially intelligent Marcus Yallow,
				 a hacktivist, who with his friends, expose the government in a world where another 9/11 happened, 
				 with the citizens being constantly under surveillance, and demonstrates the importance of rights, activism, and above
				 all, tranquility of a democratic society.</p>
                
                <h1 class="section-heading"> Research Papers </h1>
                <h4><i>Research papers I find interesting</i></h4>
                <hr>
                <h3><a  href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timo_Gnambs/publication/280008475_What_makes_a_computer_wiz_Linking_personality_traits_and_programming_aptitude/links/55a36f0708ae3ae6facf9dad.pdf">What makes a computer whiz?</a></h3>
                <h5>By: Tim Gnambs</h5>
                <p> Interesting paper. I found it kind of hard to decipher. However, the author provides several definite factors explaining
                    the nature of computer programmers, which I kind of find false, since many programmers I know are VERY extroverted. Of course, it's only a study. Still, very nice to read. </p>
                <h3><a href="http://www.federicogobbo.name/pub/J.2013.3.pdf">Why Zombies Can't Write Significant Source Code</a></h3>
                <h5>By: Fredrico Gobbo, Marco Benini</h5>
                <p>Your daily dosage of philosophy. Again, hard to decipher, with its "levels of abstraction", "levels of consciousness", and                     other philosophical talk munched together with computational science talk. It mostly explains why humans are the only people
                that can ever code, since robots, no matter how advanced, will never able to replicate human creativity. Reminds me of every
                Isaac Asimov book ever.</p>
