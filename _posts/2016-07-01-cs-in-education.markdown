Hey guys, I'm back! I went through camp, finished school for the year, and now I will be back on a weekly schedule.

Today, I want to talk about education and computer science education advancements in our society today. This post is __very__ opinionated, and is just what I think is the current situation with CS education. At the end, I want to include my own propositions.

I think computer science education is great. It helps students understand modern technologies and the everlasting changes that occur within technologies. However, I think the notion of "CS education for all" has been altered ever since the conception. I have written a research paper that explored the ideas of CS education for all. I will link it, and include some excerpts within my paper. A quote by Linda Grandell and et al. to think about:

  > Deciding what to teach novices about programming and what programming language to use is a common topic for debate. -Grandell, et Al.

Although this paper was written in the 1990s, this idea is still rational. We see that today, many platforms are created to teach computer science. However,
teaching computer science has been emphasized so that it mostly reflects upon the **youth**. We see many implementations of platforms such as Hour of Code,
Google Code, and Codeacademy. If you go on these sites, we can observe that they are widely implemented in education, especially in elementary and middle schools in order to initiate **"Computer Science for All"**. Another example is the Scratch programming language, which has been around for quite a while.

  > The original design of Scratch was motivated by the needs and interests of
    young people (ages 8 to 16) at after-school computer centers such as the Intel
    Computer Clubhouses [Resnick et al. 2003]. -Maloney, et Al.

Why children? Well, you may keep hearing in the news how computer science jobs are slowly declining, and many lawmakers and politicians want such positions to be filled, especially by females (starting off projects such as Girls Who Code by Google). And even if chidren don't __want__ to become programmers or developers, many jobs still utilize modern technologies, such as electronic health records in medicine. It is still important to utilize such an education to promote well-roundness in children. As stated in my paper:

  > Not only does computer programming require knowing how to write a program by writing code in s specific programming language, it also requires logical thinking (Kelleher & Pausch, 2007). Programmers not only require creativity, but also knowledge and logical thinking skills. It is a highly complex activity, where they cannot just string together lines of code.

Therefore, educators try to make CS education simple. But has such education become __too__ simple? Well, the counter-argument to this is that teaching programming, with languages even as simple as Python can **still** be very confusing, even to college-level students.

  > Many studies have pointed out difficulties experienced by university students when learning programming. Spohrer and Soloway (1986)
  showed that a few bug types constitute the majority of the mistakes made by novice programmers: construct-based problems, which make it difficult to
  learn the correct semantics of language constructs, and plan composition problems, which make it difficult to put plans together correctly. -Grandell, et Al.

Still, despite this, we can observe Hour of Code. It has a game that incorporates the popular open-world game Minecraft.

I understand that educators are attempting to make CS education very children-friendly, and that someone of my age wouldn't really grasp such a concept. But
when you teach programming, shouldn't a more straight-forward method be pursued? I get that educators are attempting to make programming seem interesting, but incorporating such an element of entertainment causes the digression of functionality. What I mean: when I teach kids how to code using blocks of code, how much use is it really?

### My Propositions

Children should be introduced to using a computer at an elementary-level stage. I was taught typing, using Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, downloading programs, just basic stuff. Students should also be taught how to conduct research. It is important to introduce children to the notion that they can learn **anything** they want. This is how I  became who I am today. Children should be told that there are no limitations to knowledge. This idea will carry with them throughout their lives.

At a middle-school level, students can choose to pursue computer science. Of course, all students should be urged to take an introductory course. If they do not have any interest, they can choose not to take it the year after. When teaching computer science, students should **never ever** use a notebook. There will **never** be any notes. I recommend that instructors teach Python. I believe that the incorporation of such a basic yet functional programming language
into education can help spark interest in those who may even consider a career in CS. Instructors could also teach HTML, as students may feel motivated throughout writing their own websites. Instructors should **never** give tests. However, homework should be assigned. Homework should be flexible, where students should feel excited to complete it. They should include variables of entertainment and incorporation of creativity, and instructors should encourage
students to share off their work. I believe that the best level of engagement when teaching programming is the fact that students can create games. Games should be treated as projects. Students should feel proud of creating games, and should be encouraged to show it off. When students realize that they can create their **own** games, shit can turn up.

Instructors should also introduce students to programming concepts. For example, what an IDE is, what an interpreter is. It is up to them to make it fun and engaging. However, it is crucial to introduce them to such concepts, allowing them to become more familiarized with theory so that when they learn programming
at a more advanced level, they won't get disengaged due to confusion. Instructors should **never** use stuff like Hour of Code.

At the high-school level, students should be fully familiarized with programming with Python. I think at this level, instructors should actually use Linux and teach students how to develop within Linux. At the same time, instructors, should introduce students to different programming languages, such as Java, which encourages application development. Instructors should also introduce Git, and how to use it.
A great platform is [Github Classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/), where students can be assigned assignments and learn how to use Git to push it to a repository. Instructors should always be there to help students, but also leave room for students to do their own research, and troubleshoot problems on their own.

In conclusion, I think that computer science education has become **too** simplified. Teaching computer science has come down to students moving a Minecraft character using blocks of code. It is not functional, and it is useless. Yes, it is very engaging, and yes, it still has value in education, where students are empowered by their creativity. But what use does it have?

The simple solution? Instructors should teach children programming at a young age. However, they are **not** teachers. They do not teach, they show. They show students how to write code, and allow the students to do it themselves. Writing code is about __independency__. When writing code, students should never be afraid to do their own research, and add their own gist to their code. Students should never be afraid to show off. Students should never be afraid to ask questions. It is the idea of openness and discovery that allows students to learn code, **not** over-simplicity and over-engagement.

In my research paper, I have talked about using videos to teach programming. I wanted to see how it has effect on student logical thinking. I used videos from [Bucky Roberts](www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston). I gave students logical questions from a test, the SHSAT, which is a test for specialized high school admission in NYC. Students were completely disengaged, and this can be seen because of the decreasing overall test scores. After talking to students, they were completely bored after watching even a few minutes of one of the videos. I will link it for the public to view:
