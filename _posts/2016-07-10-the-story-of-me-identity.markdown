I never reveal much about me. Not because I'm scared of the police or some sort of big brother government eye, hovering over my life as if I was a lab rat. I don't do anything illegal, nor give off the image that what I do is illegal.

We as a society has conformed to such stereotypes. One example is #blacklivesmatter. Blacks and African-Americans, especially those living in low-income areas are often seen as *criminals** or *thugs*. But in opinion, #blacklivesmatter has nothing to do with blacks and racism towards them. It is aimed at the cruelty and brutality of police officers, which now we have stereotypical identify not as men and women sworn to protect civilians, but just anger racists who love beating up black people. Maybe Alton Sterling did have a gun and did wanted to shoot a homeless man. But the fact is, he wasn't __resisting__ to the police. And even if he was, there were other alternatives rather than beating him senseless and shooting him in the chest.

But I digress. The point is, society as a whole is like a function. It takes an input, processes it, and spits out an output. The input is some sort of information. "The Asians in my school are good at math". Based on this kind of data, society processes this information and spits out the stereotype that "all Asians are good at math". Now because everyone has such a fixed idea, if you see an Asian fail at math, he/she is often shamed. And trust me, this happens in my school quite a lot. And you can't blame it on the people. Its often times media and the information reflected to us based on what is occurring in our world that allows these ideas to form fixed into peoples' minds. Islam is a terrorist religion. Mexicans are rapists. etc.

In the culture of hacktivism and technology, a clear hierarchy exists. We have script kiddies who "ping" IPs and fry routers. We have greenhorns who aspire to learn and has the potential to be great. We have intermediate hackers, who are getting there, and the best of the really best, who are those we don't even know about. There are programmers and devs, electronic hobbyists, engineers, activists, etc who work together to form a community that collaborates and helps the world through their technological advances.

Let's jump outside this inner-circle. What do average people think about the hacker culture? Hackers deserve to be punished. All hackers are malicious. And there are those who endorse them. "Hack *x's* Facebook please. Hack this please. etc."

I always make sure that my identity is protected. Although at times I would accidentally release my name, I still attempt to keep everything convoluted and at a minimal. Media, Hollywood, the news, and the exaggerations of society made the hacker culture appear as a malicious group of immature and antagonistic teenagers who cause harm and wreak havoc.

So I talk about *"the plight of my identity".* What does this mean? I am talking about the fight of my identity. How I combat and mask my true self with a facade I call "the norm". What society dictates as "normal". Friends, a social life, good grades, a healthy relationship with others. And trust me, I have all of that, and I love it. I have people to communicate with, and people who really have helped me progress through life. But my true self, my "hacker at night" side, I don't reveal.

And what have I learned from this experience? You are unique. You are who you are. But society is cruel. Society is judgmental. Throughout a VERY long span of time society has existed, we see these clearly existent boundaries. Superiority is determined by color, your looks, your gender, etc. Although its difficult to overcome the plights and escape the society surrounded by barriers and stereotypes, always try. You are unique. I myself has never come to terms with myself and my identity, and I continue to struggle with it. Please, reader, be yourself. Don't brag and show off, be modest, be a person of good faith, but please remember, your identity shouldn't be something of a burden. Don't ever alter it, unless you have cause harm to others. Learn to embrace and understand it, rather than diverge.

Individualism.
