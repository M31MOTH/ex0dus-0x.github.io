  <p>OK, first off, I'm not from Anonymous. Of course, I respect this group for their commitment and worldwide diffusion of their
                    hacktivist ethos.</p>
                <p> After putting that aside, I would like to say that I am quite proud of my skill in penetration testing. I hope to have a 
                    successful career in penetration testing, computer security, and even a hacktivist at night! I also hope you the best, 
                    aspiring hacker-reader, in your journey in learning the art of hacking and intrusion. I wish to help you the best I can 
                    (Project idea: IRC?????) and spread my 4-years of learning hacking/penetration testing.</p>
                <h4 class="section-heading"> First things first...</h4>
                <p>Here is a nice set of morals I follow every day. I am not a black hat, nor a script kiddy, and I abide by these set of                            rules (which is ironic, since hackers <i>break</i> rules. I hope that you will, with your integrity, follow mine, or even
                    your own set of values and be truthful and live by it, like a real revolutionary hero is like.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Hacking isn't a superpower. It is an art, a sacred practice. I'm not trying to sound like Confucius, but do not 
                    take advantage of a new profound skill, in a bad and negative way. This means <b>DO NOT BE A BLACKHAT!</b> You are a 
                    hacktivist, a combination of hacker and activist, and as one, you are also taking upon the role of a hero, a symbol.</li>
                    <li> Hackers are creatorsYou aren't a hacker if you just learned how to deface a site, or backdoor a server. A hacker                             possesses many traits. 
                    Most respectable hacktivists I know are courageous, selfless, and ready to do anything for their cause. They do not give
                    up, and with their profound skill, think outside the box. I remember one the public library's database was flawed. Not 
                    because of a certain exploit, but a human flaw, where their password was a 4-digit PIN. Through figuring out this flaw
                    I generated a wordlist of all 4 digit numeric characters possible (from 0000 to 9999) and once I obtained a username, 
                    was able to crack it with Burp Suite. </li>
                    <li>Don't be a script kiddy. Hackers are studious (but they do shit in school, no surprise there) and dedicate their
                    lives to studying every aspect of computer science, programming, hacking, social engineering, electronics, etc. An 
                    example that I see A LOT is the DoS attack. Executing one is SO easy, and it requires 3 steps. 1. Get LOIC 2. Obtain the
                    person that pissed you off on Xbox's IP through a grabber (sniffer, I guess is the "politically correct term") 3. Click 
                    IMMA CHARGIN MY LASER. There, you are now a member of Anonymous because you sent a tremendous amount of data to one's 
                    router. Also, in relation to script kiddies, do not get into argument. Script Kiddy: IMMA BOOT YOUR FUCKING ASS OFF THE 
                    INTERNET. Don't fight them. Don't threaten. Reason with them, but assert yourself as a person that is smarter and more 
                    mature. </li>
                    
                </ul>

                <p> One thing people always asked me was where to start. I believe that it is up to them, but I always think that the best 
                    way was to learn the fundamentals. People always are eager to learn, and they yet end up on the wrong step of the path,
                    and can really screw things up. You have to have a good foundation of knowledge, that makes you technical, as well as help
                    you learn more advanced subjects faster, and more efficiently. For example, after learning python, I was able to understand                       code in Python, and because of this, was able to configure the source code for a pentesting tool to fit my needs. What
                    languages do I recommend? Thanks you asking.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    HTML - <i> HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the code that is used to write websites. I am currently writing this 
                        article in HTML. This is a very easy language, and I learned it not even in a week, but a few days. I learned it to
                        write websites, but if you are wondering why it has use for hacking, it enables you to help understand the anatomy of 
                        a site more, such as when you are conducting a SQL Injection, or even just looking at a webpage to look for any vector
                        to launch to an attack. Alongside HTML is CSS, which is used to simply make sites look pretty (like Bootstrap.css, 
                        which made this site pretty) and Javascript, which is used to add interactivity to the site, such as buttons, 
                        animations, etc.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Python - <i>I believe that this is the easiest and most useful programming language ever created. It is very VERY useful                            and resourceful, and is "batteries included", meaning that it comes with its own IDE (Integrated Development                                        Environment). The code is very easy to learn and comprehend, and is the language recommended for all beginners.</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Next...</h2>
                <p><b>READ.</b>To learn, you have to learn to read. <a href="texts.html">Suggested Readings</a> provide some of my favorite 
                    books, ones that you'll like as well. Some books on programming are there as well. There really isn't other ways to learn.
                    If you are a visual learner, videos may work out for you, such as when I was learning code. I used both resources and 
                    helped me effectively learn code.</p>
                <p>C|EH, or Certified Ethical Hacker All-In-One, is a very good book for beginners that is also technical, and widely used as
                    a textbook. It introduces you to everything basic in hacking, and with this fundamental knowledge, you can move on to 
                    more advanced things. </p>
