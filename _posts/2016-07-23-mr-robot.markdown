Mr. Robot is a show that started to air on the USA network last year. A few weeks ago, we saw that the premiere of its first episode of the second season.

### The Impact

Mr. Robot has received quite a lot of praise from critics __AND__ hackers a like for its realism not only technological-wise, but also society-wise. Sam Esmail, the shows creator, has done a great job of research and making the show not only a breakthrough in entertainment, but a large breakthrough in the cyberpunk world. Its many themes within the show demonstrate the world we live in - is a huge facade.

The show has been widely advertised and received great reviews. As I walk throughout the subways of New York City, advertisements pop up nearly every station, with the face of the protagonist, Elliot, or his deceased father, "Mr. Robot", who appears as an illusion inside Elliot, controlling and manipulating his psyche.

The hacking in the show is nevertheless real. [Null-Byte](http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/mr-robot-hacks/), a hacking and pentesting community on WonderHowTo, created an entire section dedicated to the meticulous dissection of the scenes of hacking within Mr. Robot.

#Warning: SPOILERS!

### A little summary

Elliot Anderson works as a computer programmer within Allsafe, a cybersecurity company in New York City. He suffers from depression and social anxiety. The series follows him as he meets Mr. Robot,a mysterious man who recruits him to work with a group of hackers known as "fsociety", who will soon be notorious for unleashing the greatest hack against E-Corp, a global business conglomerate and the main antagonist, who stereotypes the sleazy, rich scumbag businessmen and women that run the world with their wealth and power.

### The Realism

Let's look at the new season. If you have not watched the new season or Mr. Robot at all, beware of spoilers.

I think that this new season will focus on __2 main themes__: Elliot and his struggle for control and fsociety fighting for control after their climatic hack.

Hacking in the show has become more realistic as well. The utilization of real-life

Let's examine.

When we first start off in the first episode of the second season, we can see a few "easter-eggs". Right in the beginning of the episode, we see Elliot on a terminal.

We can see Elliot establishing a SSH conection an __E-Corp__ server, and the wonderful community of Reddit discovered that it is an actual URL to a site set up by the USA network. This comes back to the notion of the facade we see today in society.

No words needed for that. Let's continue on. We see Darlene, Elliot's sister utilizing __SEToolkit__, a very popular social-engineering pentesting suite. She is seen creating a payload, which is some sort of Ransomware.

We continue and see that the Bank of E Corp experiencing technical difficulties. Patrons of the bank are unable to retrieve withdrawals. This is largely contributed to Darlene's Ransomware, which we can see is in large effect.

Mobley, one of fsociety's hackers, impersonates an IT technician and attempts to "fix" the current situation. However, if you look at the image a little closely, we are able to see a joker face. This is atually reference to [th3j35t3r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jester_%28hacktivist%29), a grey-hat hacktivist that has caused devastating DoS attacks utilizing a tool that he has wrote himself, known as Xerxes.

In the next episode, we see Mobley making contact with Romero, a retired phreaker. This reference itself further proves the realism of the show, as phreaking is the art of hacking, but with implementation on telecommunication systems and is a predecessor to the modern-day computer hacking. Although Captain Crunch is known as a pioneer in phreaking, Romero still refers to himself as the one who actually started phreaking.

Mobley visits Romero later, finding out that he was shot and killed. In this scene however, we can see another reference.

If you look closely you are able to make out the popular penetration testing Linux distro, Kali Linux on Romero's computer. Neat right?

Finally, we can see in the most recent episode Elliot getting back into the game, after having an inner battle with Mr.Robot. He contacts Darlene, who is in danger from the FBI and a new surveillance program setup. They make contact through IRC, utilizing a very popular CLI-based IRC client, known as [BitchX](http://www.bitchx.com/).

### The Impact

Mr Robot is __NOT__ just a show. It is symbolism. Through the realism of the hacking, themes, and even display of actual real-life brands and products, we see the show delivering sublimal messages about the world. And unfortunately, they are quite true. The world isn't a wonderful place. We come to face problems every day and although it may be transparent to us, it is happening. War, oppression, and the opposition between man/woman and government are just a few daily problems.

My advice? Don't watch Mr. Robot cause its a good TV show. Watch it for value. It is a show that provides a gateway to reality. We look at the introspection of Elliot and his plight of identity, as well as Angela, Elliot's childhood friend and her conflicts of interest with E-Corp, a corporation she hates for the cover-up of her mother's death, and Darlene, who is in constant emotional instability after the climatic hack on E-Corp, leading to fear for her life as well as her fellow fsociety members. We look at Evil Corp, and realize that it isn't just one corporation, but instead it acts as a representation of many we see in our world today.

I hope this article brought a little light to the problems concerning society and the reflections from Mr. Robot. I hope I will continue to write and actually take a stand for the problems we see in the world today.
