The New Year has seen many changes. We have now seen the election of a new President, with the introduction of controversial political candidates, such as the new Director of the FCC. The clemency of Chelsea Manning, through former President Obama, has also been a controversial topic, which has now lead to us believing: "What will Edward Snowden do?" Will he come back to face justice, under a new presidency, or will he stay in Russia?  

## 2017

It is quite unclear what we will see in this year. However, as the new year comes, resolutions and new plans have developed for me as well. I will of course, continue to blog, continue to post, and continue my projects and endeavors. In fact, I will be starting a nonprofit startup soon, and with that, we will work towards making cybersecurity education, including ethical hacking, computer science, computer networking, and other CS-related topics available to the public.  

We continue to live in a society where rights of individual citizens are being violated on a daily basis. This new year has presented us new challenges, and new obstacles. However, as people, we are presented the right to protest and the right to petition. It is important to us that we stand up for our rights, and our beliefs. Protest is a beautiful thing, and there should be no limit to it being exercised.  

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend a conference with many cybersecurity enthusiasts and consultants, who have provided me a new insight: "security is just an illusion". Yes, it is such a clich√©, but I have finally understood the meaning of it. We live in a society surrounded by technology. As the advancement of technology exponentially progresses, software and hardware will introduce new vulnerabilities, bugs, and hackable code. We have seen the Shadow Brokers release NSA tools and code. We have seen the devastating Mirai Botnet, taking over an uncountable amount of IOT devices and other vulnerable hardware, and its devastating effect. The ideal of security is more like a theory: although security does exist, it will NEVER become FULLY secure.  

Thank you for the past year. It has been a great time so far, and I really am looking forward to another year. I hope to see many things change in the world surrounded by technology. I will continously work towards a better future, one API at a time.
