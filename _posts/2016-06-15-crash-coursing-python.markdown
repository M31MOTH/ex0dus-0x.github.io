Python is programming langauge written by Guido van Ross... blah blah.

Anyway, if you are here with me, I'm pretty sure you know what the Python Programming language is. I'm not going to explain it. This is
an interactive tutorial. Time to conduct some research for yourself now :P

So today, I'm going to cover the basics of the Python programming languages. Keep in mind that this is a crash-course, and therefore it is for the experienced programmer. Well not necessarily, but just someone who is familiar with code.

### Note: I have embedded Trinket.io, which is an interactive python interpreter and IDLE.
Use this! I know for a fact many people are quite lazy, so therefore, I've decided to implement Trinket.io's web-based Python IDLE and interpreter. When executing code, you may use this to do so.

All the code in this tutorial will be in Python 2. NOT 3.

### Let's get started.

First, Python is interpreter-based. Think of a language that is interpreter-based being a cookbook. You will read a step, do that step, and then move on the next. That is the essential concept of an interpreter-based programming language. Each line of code is examined before execution. A compiler-based programming language, or commonly referred as object-oriented, is like reading all the steps in the
cookbook, and THEN completing each step.
