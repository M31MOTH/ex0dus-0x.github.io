I am a high-school student and systems engineer residing in NYC. I have a keen interest in cybersecurity, low-level programming,
programming language design, and electrical engineering. While I am proficient in full-stack web development, I have developed a 
steady love-hate relationship with it <i>*sigh</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
Nowadays, I program, design, and do pentest labs on my abomination of a Kali Linux distro. Here are
my <a href="https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>, but I'm working on a new i3-gaps rice. 
My current programming languages comprise of Rust, C/C++, Python and (a lil) x86 Intel Assembly.
I love Rust's type safety implementation, but it's ownership system has led to a steep learning curve.
          </p>
          <p>
In the future, I hope to acquaint myself with deep learning, using IPython/Jupyter and
frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras. I wish to attend CMU or NYU to major in
biomedical engineering / computer + electrical engineering, and minor in cybersecurity.
