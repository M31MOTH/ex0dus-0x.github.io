             I am currently a full-time high school student and part-time developer residing in NYC.
             I love cybersecurity, systems programming, as well as full stack web development (best of both worlds).
             Still, I enjoy developing with low-level languages (i.e. C/C++, Rust), as well as modern 
             scripting languages (i.e. Python, Ruby).
          </p>

            I've been writing code for a very long time, and it has been a life-long passion. I'm also a Linux enthusiast, and I eat,
            sleep and breathe Linux and bash. I also have a keen interest in security, 
            specifically penetration testing (I love Kali Linux). Combining that with code, I write applications for pentesters 
            and hackers alike so that I can better understand the vulnerabilities of security and how they can get fixed.

            In the future, I hope to acquaint myself with data science and analysis, with libraries such as <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code>.
            I wish to start a nonprofit cybersecurity awareness organization for the succeeding generation of hackers/programmers, and to attend CMU or NYU
            to study <b>biomedical engineering</b> and/or <b>computer science</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a life-long learner and always ready to learn new skills, I will never turn my back on developing ground-breaking 
            technologies.
