<h2> FAQ </h2>
<h4>1. When did you start learning code/pentesting?</h4>
I started learning code at around 10, when the first language I learned was on KhanAcademy, which was some sort of Javascript. I quickly moved on to dabble in
other languages,the first being Python. I learned it briefly before moving my focus to HTML. I used to go to the library to pick up a bunch of books on HTML w
eb development, and with that, learned CSS. I also refered to a lot of YouTube videos at the time, using them as aid. I eventually familiarized myself with Bootstrap.css, and
created a prototype site, which was pretty awful. I am still continuing to learn to code, with C++, C#, Python, Rust, JS, and more. </p>

<p> In terms of penetration testing, I actually started 2 years ago. The first book that got me familiarized with the hacktivist world was
The Hacker's Underground Handbook. Continuing on, I read C|EH All-in-One and also watching a lot of Youtube videos, going on forums, and
reading more books. I started familiarizing myself with the Linux operating system, playing around with Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux, and
such. I I familiarized myself with crytography, encryptions, and networking, and how to crack WEP networks. Continuing on, I started to
learn how to use Metasploit, and creating payloads and familiaizing myself with exploits and exploit databses, such as Exploit-DB. There
is still more to tell, but I am still an amateur, and still have a lot to learn. </p>
<h4>2. Who do you admire the most?</h4>
<p> My old FB/Twitter profile picture is of Aaron Swartz, a hacktivist that unfortunately died 2 years ago due to suicide. He is known for
authoring RSS at my age, 14, which is pretty incredible, as well as partnering the creation of Reddit, and starting campaigns that advocate
human rights, freedom, and political activism. He unfortunately killed himself because of data-theft, when he wrote a Python script that
downloaded a bunch of documents from JSTOR, who sold research papers and articles for large sums of money, despite the fact that those
papers should be free for the world to read.</p>
<p> Alan Turing, was a British mathematician that helped cracked the German Nazi Enigma code, by pioneering the first ever computer. His
innovation and genius, made him one of the world's heroes, but his homosexuality shamed him and, unfortunately also caused his suicide.
However, in 2013, he was given a pardon.</p>
