//A Hacker Story // Written By: ex0dus-0x // Part 1
===================================================

What was interesting about the computer was the operating system. Windows.

Well not that interesting. Just a vulnerable human error. No updates, gullible to download whatever. Classic human error.

Implementing a payload within the program was very easy. Metasploit, then Veil-Evasion. Didn't even matter, considering the fact that an
AV isn't even present.

A hacker is only proficient as his/her brains allow them to be. Technicality is nothing. Observation is everything. The most vulnerable
machine - isn't even a machine. It's the human itself. The profoundity and absurdity of the program really took me by surprise, how such
a deemed intelligent man like my high school principal will fall for it and download it. "Free iTunes Gift Card Generator.exe".

Deemed intelligent. My ass. Well, to be fair, Dr. Daniels was not so tech-savvy. He's still really old fashioned.

Nice. Meterpreter. Gonna set up persistence. Maybe a quick Python backdoor.

My name is j4s0n. I'm a hacker. Yes. H A C K E R. At night. Derp.

At day, I am a mundane high school student, scourging the halls of high school with a facade. No one knows who I really am.

And yes my real name is Jason. I know, I know, it's sort of idiotic, but if you think about it, it's counter-intuitive. Most of the time, the
police, if they ever catch up to me, will never actually search up Jason if they are attempting to identify me. Most of the time, people who get
a handle call themselves something that DIVERGES greatly form the norms of their real name and lives. But hey, even if they do search up Jason,
there are 3 million Jasons in San Francisco (I checked).

The webcam was easily exposed. Snap.

Microphone? Exposed. Let's start recording for some time. My 5 TB HDD is plenty. And my NAS server. And my backup SSD and several large-sized USBs I salvaged.

What am I trying to do to my principal? Why am I conducting such a malicious deed?

Lemme give you a lil' rundown of the current situation. Ever since the release of the latest iOS version from Apple, major bugs have been discovered and
exploited. Of course, I have written a buffer that targets non-updated iOS devices. It utilizes Bluetooth, and exploits the newly released "Food and Drinks"
app, which tried to compete with Yelp. It is really devastating, but Apple, as the scumbag company it is, under its new CEO, decided to leave the version
signed, and released a beta update for developers. So a majority of Apple users still have an non-updated iOS device. Of course, I do not have an iOS device,
but a self-built device with a custom bootloader and OS, called w4tchd0g OS, named appropriately after the game. It's like a full-fledged Kali OS, but better
x1000.

Anyway, Apple decided to tell the FBI and the NSA of their bugs they don't bother to fix. This allowed the government and federal agencies to develop tools for
the police, security companies, private military contractors, and yep, schools. One of the lucky bitches, Dr. David Daniels, who also is a member of the Board
of Education, obtained a copy of such tools. Of course, him being tech-dumb, gave the tools to the IT department at the school. And by the IT department, I
mean James Crane, a fellow underground hacker at night. Through him kissing up to Dr. Daniels 24/7, earned a position as an IT, but secretly acts as a malicious
man-in-the-middle. Like all the hacktivists, he was infuriated by the act of privacy invasion, and told me on XMPP OTR. Crane told me that Dr. Daniels plans
to conduct surprise investigations. Now he tells me that Dr. Daniels wants a copy of the tool with instructions, since he plans to use it personally when
interrogating students. What a fucking cunt.

Of course, the tool is really hard to disassemble. It was written by top programmers within the NSA and FBI, and me, being an amateur reverse engineer and
malware analyzer, cannot take it apart. So naturally, I had to change plans. Of course, I had Dr. Daniel's email. All I had to do was impersonate Apple using
a fake domain, get a nice header and some professional looking fonts, and hack the fuck out of Dr. Daniel's computer. Task wasn't difficult, especially
when your target is tech-challenged.

OK, I got some nice stuff for a good D0x. I already knew his address; wasn't too difficult to find after some online snooping and recon. He had a wife and
son in college, and distant family in Kansas. Interesting...credit cards, credit reports, nice nice. Very comprehensive D0x. Now time to release with the
evidence.
