//A Hacker Story // Written By: ex0dus-0x //
==================================================

I was never any real computer hacker. That is, COMPUTER hacker. 

2022 was the iconic year that the government launched the National Security Acts of 2022. This granted police, any authoritative power view any data on anybody's devices with AND without supervision, with AND without a warrant. Even with the hacktivist world launching a full-fledged social justice campaign with over $500K of donations, it was no use. So the hacker world retreated. Planning meticulously for any chance of attack. 

2023 is a great year for mobile devices. That is, hacking it. After Apple's large-scale attack on its iOS system, the entire iPhone was quickly decentralized to the underground hacker universe. People found ways to open-source the OS. Someone released instructions on the darknet hacktivist-pirate forum D33pC3ntr41 on how to install a full-fledged Android system on iOS. Cydia became obsolete, and Saurik, along with other hackers built an operating system instead called "CyOS". Cydia was the main package manager/application store. It came with so much hacker goodies. A much improved terminal with Git, apt-get, and other must-have packages. A new browser Hackzilla, (D33pC3ntr4l as the homepage) that implements Tor, self-destructing cookies, a dedicated and advanced adblocker, and AE5 encryption for all saved passwords, and MUCH more. 

But it wasn't THAT impressive. Writing an OS for the newly cracked iOS devices are easy. That's why I wrote my own.

See, I am secretly the founder of the WatchDogs OS. That's right. Named after the video game. And guess what my OS does. Yep. The only thing that's missing is ctOS. At the least the government is not implementing some city-automation operating system that has a few million vulnerabilities. But my OS is just as good. I have implemented my own VoIP system. It's very secure, and basically has the same concept as Skype, but 100000000x secure and is run by a group of furtive hackers that I know personally and trust. It is P2P, and will only work with other users using the same VoIP system. The idea behind it is very simple: each user identifies by a unique ID. It looks like this: 1ca:21db:abc. However, I have made the system so that it works like public-key encryption. The unique ID is the public key. You have your own private ID that you have created. In this case, your fingerprint. In order to accept calls, the public key must be trusted, and using the TouchID feature on the Home button, you can accept the call. Numbers and identities are disposable, of course.

Apart from that, my OS is a hacker paradise. Everything: nmap, Metasploit, burpsuite, SQLmap. GUI and CLI. I even wrote a script that uploads BadUSB once a cord is tethered to the computer, as well as one that automatically backdoors a computer using meterpreter, SSH, whatever you choose. The OS contains several programming languages that are default, such as Python, Ruby, and C/C++. A simple and minimalistic text editor and IDE, called m1tn1ck is also available. And plus, the UI elements are fucking sexy. It looks like a dark noir version of Samsung mashed with Apple with Watch Dogs. Just talking about it makes me moist. 

Anyway, enough of that. My name is sw33tsp0t. Here's my story.

College can't be paid. Jobs can't be found. And the government is still dedicated to fucking with your metadata. That's why I stopped using computers as my source of hacking. Kali was compromised. Whonix was compromised. Even Tails was compromised.

I keep two phones on me. My Droid, which contains numbers of my parents, "daytime" friends, etc. It has 2048, Facebook, Instagram, your average shit.

The second one is my iPhone with WatchDogs OS. However, even with WatchDogs OS, I still hide it under my regular iOS 10. Too risky. I was frisked at least 5 times. GOod thing is I was able to take out the external drive of the newest iPhone design and replace it with a pirated 5 TB drive I bought from a dealer. To the police, it looks like a regular 32GB iPhone 8S, and even with intensive filesystem scanning, the WatchDogs OS is neatly hidden in a secret partition made possible with phoneCrypt, the mobile implementation of TrueCrypt.

Sitting in the cafe alone is awful. AP Biology is already bad enough, so I went to get another coffee. Luckily, the cafe's network is public. Some packet sniffing and phishing allowed me to get a few people's Facebook passwords. I looked around. Every guy had a significant other. Sigh. Guess it's just you and me, iPhone.

As if the iPhone heard me, it buzzed. 5 pips. I instantly knew who it was. After looking around for facial recognition cameras and realizing there was none, I picked it up, and started the call. <UNKNOWN> was the caller ID. Well that is everyone's moniker, but I knew exactly who this was.

"Jordan."

"Don't you dare say my name. It's Lud1kr0us."

"Fine, whatever. What do you want?"

"Listen, there's been a data leak released on the d33pc3ntral. The admins asking for YOU to decipher all of it and release it to the public."

I stood up. Shit. I was popular because of WatchDog OS, but I didn't know SO popular that the admins actually knew who I was. 

"I'm coming."

Tech is expensive. My computer is a cheap $500 Chromebook running a traditional BlackArch linux installation. My network and router is secured with OpenWRT, and I do not use the traditional "clearnet" Internet. I use a more "hacker" network, Plunder. Plunder was created by the PirateBay guys, and the aim of it was to "plunder" and categorize torrent sites, since the government was constantly taking them down. However, still, people have started blogs and journalism organizations on it, but that was pretty much it. There weren't much space reserved for these guys, so the network was pretty limited to a small range of sites, all written by partners of the PirateBay guys, since they have full control of the network.Still, the Plunder Browser was VERY secure, and supported I2P and Tor, which is actually MUCH more secure than it was in the past, so everyone utilized that on desktop, since there was no Plunder alternative for mobile and other platforms. Hackzilla was already exploited for the desktop, so no one resort to using it. Still, out of paranoia, I don't use it that much. Everything, clear or darknet, was routed through Tor and proxies. It was a pretty complicated rig. I used my computer to mostly write code.

Today I made an exception. I opened up Terminal, and typed "cd Photos/Bahamas". The folder was empty except for a few picture of the Bahamas, but I still typed "./plunder", and a browser started. That was another great thing about the Plunder Browser. It was not a traditional package you could get. 

After navigating to the d33pc3ntr41 .onion site, I logged in with the three-factor authentication method. A message encrypted in PGP was waiting for me. After decrypting it, I read it.
