<h2 class="section-heading"> D0xk1t </h2>

<p>This is a tool I've created in python for the sole purpose of writing a D0x. In the world of hacking, D0xing is viewed as script-kiddish AND illegal and harmful.
People often look down at those who write D0x. However, this tool is created not to harm. Instead, it allows hackers and hacktivists to be able to practice their reconaissance and allow themselves and others to better protect themselves by not exposing too much of their information on the Internet.
