<h2 class="section-heading"> D0xk1t</h2>
<img src="/img/doxkit.png">

<p>This is a tool I've created in python for the sole purpose of writing a D0x. D0xing is viewed as script-kiddish, illegal and harmful.
People often look down at those who write D0x. However, this tool is created not to harm. Instead, it allows hackers and hacktivists to be able to practice their reconaissance and allow themselves and others to better protect themselves by not exposing too much of their information on the Internet.

<h2 class="section-heading">PyPayload</h2>
<img src="/img/pypayload.png">

<p>This is a tool designed specifically for the task of automation. It allows the ease of
creating payloads using Metasploit's msfvenom, which combines the task of payload creation and encoding.
Users specify the flags, and the program does the rest. Many payload options are available, but only currently for Windows.
Future support for Android and Linux.</p>
