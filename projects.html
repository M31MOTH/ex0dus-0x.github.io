<h2 class="section-heading"> D0xk1t</h2>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gaE36AN.png">

<p>This is a tool I've created in python for the sole purpose of writing a D0x. D0xing is viewed as script-kiddish, illegal and harmful.
People often look down at those who write D0x. However, this tool is created not to harm. Instead, it allows hackers and hacktivists to be able to practice their reconaissance and allow themselves and others to better protect themselves by not exposing too much of their information on the Internet.

<h2 class="section-heading">PyPayload</h2>
<img "http://i.imgur.com/f3JlmRZ.png">

<p>This is a tool designed specifically for the task of automation. It allows the ease of
creating payloads using Metasploit's msfvenom, which combines the task of payload creation and encoding.
Users specify the flags, and the program does the rest. Many payload options are available, but only currently for Windows.
Future support for Android and Linux.</p>

<p>This is a project that supports dictionary attacks for several protocols, with the aim of being an all-in-one suite
for many protocols and services. The current protocols that are complete and in support are:
<pre>
ssh
ftp
smtp
XMPP
instagram
facebook

<h3> Won Privacy Hack at defhacks() 2016 </h3>

In collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/JonW27"><b>JonW27</b></a>, we built a framework that targets network protocols and services.
It utilizes a Metasploit interpreter-like shell, and several modules that represent different network protocols. Looking at the tree
view of all the modules and its attack vectors:

<pre>
  main
|
+--SSH
|    +--
|       |- bruteforce - bruteforce vulnerable SSH server
|
+--SMTP
|     +--
|        | - bruteforce - bruteforce SMTP address (aka email)
|        |
|        | - smsbomb - utilizes smtp-to-email gateway to spam SMS messages
|
+--HTTP
|      +--
|         | - arpspoof - MITM where user fakes ARP messages on LAN, intercepting packets from host
|         |
|         | - slowloris - Layer-7 DoS attack using slow headers and malformed GET requests to a vulnerable web server
|
+--Recon
|       +--
|          | - pscan - port scan with Nmap
|          |
|          | - hosts - scan for active hosts
|
+------
</pre>

This project will be continously worked on, as many of the modules are incomplete, and there are always going to be minor syntatical errors.
