        <p>
          D0xk1t is an open-source, self-hosted and easy to use active reconaissance web application for 
          penetration testers. Based off of the prior command-line script, D0xk1t is now fully capable 
          of conducting reconaissance and penetration testing for security researchers who need a 
          framework without the head-scratching.

        <p>
          Bruteforce framework for multiple protocols and services. This project was designed 
          as a proof-of-concept of hidden vulnerabilities within input forms, and how easy 
          webscraping can wreak havoc. I hope to develop this into a FOSS and community-supported
          framework for penetration testers in their daily activities and security practices.

        <p>
          dedsploit is a community-supported, open-source and network-based penetration 
          testing suite that supports attacks for numerous network-based protocols. 
          Although still in active development, dedsploit hopes to become a tool under every
          hacker's belt, conducting attacks in the field. It is for security purposes 
          ONLY, and aims to be used for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

        <p>
          Many projects have existed out there that turn Arduino HID keyboard 
          devices into USB rubber ducky-likes. However, these devices are already themselves HID, 
          and just require a bit of code in the form of Arduino <code>.ino</code> scripts to run. 
          At times, many people are not able to obtain Teensy devices, or just simply want to work 
          their existing hardware. We were able to build a framework that turns Arduino Unos into 
          malicious HID devices, that can gain access and escalate privileges on vulnerable machines,
          and provide an insight to the world of hardware hacking, and what preventable measures can be implemented.

          A fun attempt to get a Google Foo.bar Invitation using webscraping with Selenium and the Stackexchange
          API.

          Building the FLHS Patriot Battalion website with Jekyll, as well as a few Javascript frameworks. This enables implementation
          with a CMS for non-developers to edit the site without the befuddling code.
