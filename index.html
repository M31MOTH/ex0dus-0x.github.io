             this is my corner of the interwebs. if you are wondering "why the gif?", it 
             really just represents my growing interest in data science and visualization. 
             and plus, it contributes to the minimalist feel of the website.

            writing code has become a very important part of my life. in the last year, 
            i have particiated in my first series of hackathons. the exposure to the hacker
            culture has brought me so many new perspectives about the world that has been 
            transformed by the influx of such innovative ideas. exposing myself to world of organized development has been one of the greatest
            experiences so far. with that, i think that we can build something revolutionary.

            anyhows, this site is to document all my adventures and excursions in the field of development/cybersecurity 
            in the least egotistical way possible. you can learn more <a href="about"> about me </a> here. i actively develop several projects,
            some deemed production quality, <a href="projects">here</a> and also on <a href="https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            i also like to write through a <a href="https://blog.codemuch.tech">blog</a>, mainly on my expeditions into the standard libraries of 
            programming languages, as well as cybersec, code snippets, and tutorials (metasploit, binary exploitation, etc).
