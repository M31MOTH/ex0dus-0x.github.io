            hello world! this is my website. here, i document my adventures and endeavors into
            the world of programming, cybersecurity, and other fun miscellaneous tech stuff.
            whilst i don't actively blog, i do try my best to maintain this site as much as possible,
            representing my personal tastes in minimalism while also making sure that my front-end and
            UX isn't unfavorable for the viewer.
